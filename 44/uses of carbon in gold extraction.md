## Gold CIL &amp CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
CIL stands for carboninleach.This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.CIL is slightly different from another gold extraction process called CIP or carboninpulp process.ACTIVATED CARBON IN GOLD RECOVERY KemixTypical activated carbons used in the CarboninPulp (CIP) heated at elevated temperatures in the presence of steam to create activated carbon.In gold recovery

## Why is carbon used as a reducing agent in metallurgy? Quora
From the electrochemical potential point of view (Reactivity series): Carbon is above many important metals (e.g.Zinc,Iron,Copper,Silver,Gold) and therefore,could be used to reduce their oxides to extract the metal from them.That&#39s why carbon coke is a used widely in extractive metallurgy.How gold is made history,used,parts,procedureGold is generally found in two types of deposits: lode (vein) or placer deposits the mining technique used to extract the gold depends upon the type of deposit.Once extracted,the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation,amalgamation,cyanidation,or carboninpulp.
