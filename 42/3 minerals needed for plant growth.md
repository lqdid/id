Phosphorus: Is required for seed production,photosynthesis,fruit flower formation,bulking up,protein synthesis and just about ALL aspects of growth and metabolism in plants.A failure to supply the necessarily levels of phosphorus can lead to deficiencies very quickly,some of the symptoms of this deficiency include stunted plant growth,a reduce in yields of fruit and flowers,as well as incorrect or whispy formation of flowers.Essential Minerals for Plants Garden GuidesThey become available as nutrient content in vegetables and fruit.Soil mineral content determines plant health and plant health supports human health.Essential minerals in the soil are divided into micronutrients and macronutrients.Nitrogen,phosphorus and potassium are macronutrients that are needed in large amounts for plant growth.Secondary macronutrients are calcium,magnesium and sulfur.
