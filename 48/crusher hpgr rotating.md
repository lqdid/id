## A Closer Look at Increasing HPGR Efficiency via Reductions.
HPGR operating principles: • Two counter rotating tires (one fixed and one floating) • Hydraulic cylinders apply pressure to floating tire • The counter rotating tires draw in a bed of material • This bed of material is crushed via inter particle comminutionHigh Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) In Comparison to SAG Milling Technology Presented by: Hassan Ghaffari,P.Eng.•Counter rotating Rolls •One fixed roll,one moving roll Hydraulic Pistons Feed Floating Fixedroll.HPGR Primary Crusher Stock Pile To Process HPGR Cone Crusher Ball Mill.SAG Mill Primary CrusherThe evolution of HPGR technologyHPGR technology in order to increase throughput and decrease total cost of operations.Lars Gronvall SVP Research and Technology Development The evolution of HPGR technology HRC™ HPGR The technology HPGRs utilize two counter rotating tires one fixed and one floating in order to.HRC™ HPGR as a tertiary crusher followed by a.Roll Crusher an overview ScienceDirect Topics.Roll crushers are also manufactured with only one rotating cylinder (Figure 6.14(b)),which revolves toward a fixed plate.Other roll crushers use three,four,or six cylinders,although machines with more than two rolls are rare today.In some crushers the diameters and speeds of the rolls may differ.
