## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Tons are a weight measure.To make matters even more confusing is the fact that determining yards per ton is anything but an exact science.The weight of crushed stone in pounds per cubic yards and tons per cubic yards are approximate measures that assume all of the same material weighs the same.Calculations Yards Per Ton for Crushed StoneNC DEQ: Crushed Stone in NCCrushed stone makes up 85 percent of aggregate production; construction sand and gravel,about 15 percent.North Carolina is the eighth largest crushed stone producing state in the U.S.Aggregate is produced from about 135 crushed stone quarries and about 500 sand and gravel sites throughout the state.Use this calculator to estimate the quantity of Construction Aggregates needed for your particular job,based on width,length,thickness,and product density.
