## Amphibole
Cleavage in Amphibole.Amphibole has two cleavages running parallel to the length of the crystal.Thus elongate sections through amphibole crystals show a single cleavage,cross sections show two cleavages intersecting at 120 o.Note: grains showing two well developed cleavages may be tricky to findA n (Na 2)(Z 5)(Si m Al m O 22)(OH,F,Cl) 2 The sodium amphibole subgroup is one of the subgroups belonging to the W(OH,F,Cl) amphibole group.It is defined with Na as the dominant element in the X position (= IMA B position).Rocks with Asbestos: Risk Evaluation by Means of an.Optical Microscopy (PCOM) method to analyze the powder obtained from the mill,had been used.To simplify PCOM analysis,the sample,recovered from the mill,was selected in particle size classes: large,medium and small.Each class was separated by means of sedimentation in fibrous and granular fractions.Amphibole.The amphibole group comprises a complex group of 57 silicate minerals that,although falling in both the orthorhombic and monoclinic systems,are closely related in crystallography and other physical properties as well as in chemical composition.A general formula of members of the amphibole group is W ( 1) X 2 Y 5 Z 8 O 22 (OH,F,CI.

## Amphibolite: Mineral information,data and localities.
Amphibolite is a gneissose or granofelsic metamorphic rock mainly consisting of green,brown or black amphibole and plagioclase (including albite),which combined form ≥75% of the rock and both of which are present as major constituents; the amphibole constitutes ≥50% of the total mafic constituents and is present in an amount of ≥30%.A crystalloblastic rock consisting …sample was prepared by grinding the raw rock material in a small ball mill to the final powder of average grain size around 10 μm (estimate obtained by means of optical microscopy).The plagioclase:amphibole mass ratio was close to 1:1 for samples GKA GKC and ca 3:17 for GKD sample.B.Neutron diffraction experimentsGemRocks: Amphibole Rich RocksUSES: Each of the listed amphibole rich rocks has been fashioned into attractive cabochons and miscellaneous shaped pieces for jewelry.Amphibolites and amphibole gneisses of some rock sequences are rather attractive and have been used,albeit rarely,as gemrocks e.g.in the past,for beads; more recently as paperweights and bookends.Granite micro powder grinding mill.Granite is the most widely distributed plutonic intrusive rocks.The main mineral components are quartz,feldspar and biotite,lighter in color,gray and red meat is the most common,with granular and massive structure.

## Health risk of chrysotile revisited
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The differences in serpentine and amphibole asbestos.The physical and chemical properties which differentiate chrysotile which is a serpentine mineral from the amphibole asbestos types such as amosite and crocidolite have only recently been factored into the understanding of the toxicology and epidemiology of these minerals.Amphibole.Amphibolite is a dark,heavy,metamorphic rock composed mostly of the mineral amphibole.Amphibolites have very little to no quartz.“Amphibole” refers not to a single mineral,but to a group of minerals.Most belong to the monoclinic crystal system,but some belong to the orthorhombic crystal system.Amphibolite rock BritannicaAmphibolite,a rock composed largely or dominantly of minerals of the amphibole group.The term has been applied to rocks of either igneous or metamorphic origin.In igneous rocks,the term hornblendite is more common and restrictive; hornblende is the most common amphibole and is …For its high magnesium content,indicating Mg 2+ as a dominant cation and relationship with hornblende.The latter name hornblende was first used by 1789 by Abraham Gottlieb Werner from an old German term for dark minerals with no ore value and from &quot;blende&quot;,meaning to deceive in allusion to it occurring in ore deposits but not yielding any metal.
