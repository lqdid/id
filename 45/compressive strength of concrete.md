## Relation Between Compressive and Tensile Strength of Concrete
Compressive Strength.The main measure of the structural quality of concrete is its compressive strength.This property of concrete is commonly considered in structural design.Depending on the mix (especially the watercement ratio) and time and quality of the curing,compressive strength of concrete can be obtained up to 14,000 psi or more.Properties of concrete Wikipediacompressive strength of concrete at 28 days (psi) This equation is completely empirical and is not based on theory.Note that the value of E c found is in units of psi.For normal weight concrete (defined as concrete with a w c of 150 lb ft 3 and subtracting 5 lb ft 3 for steel) E c is permitted to be taken as ′.
