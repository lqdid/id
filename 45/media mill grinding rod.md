Rod Mill The grinding media in a Rod mill are long rods of particular material which grind the ore by tumbling within the mill.The grinding action is by line contact between the long rods.There is a very minimal slime production since rods tumble and spin in roughly parallel alignment and produce size reduction of coarse ores efficiently.Bond Index Ball Mill Rod Mill BT 100 XL RETSCHThe Bond Index conforming rod charge consists of: 6 rods of 1.25" diameter and 21" length; 2 rods of 1.75" diameter and 21" length; The grinding jar for the Bond Index Rod Mill is 12″ x 24″ in size and has a wave shaped design.At least 15 to 20 kg sample material is required to simulate a closed grinding circuit in a ball or rod mill.
