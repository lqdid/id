Ball Mills Manufacturer Ball Mill Working Principle.A ball mill is a type of grinding mill,it is an aggregate for grinding and crushing (grinder) of hard materials that has the same goal as other grinding machinery and crushing machinery.Ball mills are used for crushing and mixing of raw materials.While rotating,the grinding media (balls,beads,pulps,etc.) and the raw material rotate.Ball MillsWorking Principle &amp; Operation.The apparent difference in capacities between grinding mills (listed as being the same size) is due to the fact that there is no uniform method of designating the size of a mill,for example: a 5′ x 5′ Ball Mill has a working diameter of 5′ inside the liners and has 20 per cent more capacity than all other ball mills designated as 5′ x 5′ where the.The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.
