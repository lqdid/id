## Paper # 25
COPPER MOUNTAIN: OVERVIEW ON THE GRINDING MILLS AND THEIR DUAL PINION MILL DRIVES ABSTRACT This paper will first give a short overview of the Copper Mountain project in British Columbia,which just has started commercial operation earlier this year.The grinding process with one 34' x 20' SAGOnce the basic operating conditions have been defined for the mill designer then,and only then,can he begin taking into account shell and head stresses and trunnion bearing sizes required to carry the load and to give the required openings for feeding and discharging the mills.Mill heads are key structural components of any grinding mill.GIRTH GEARElastic mill sag by weight of mill balls and materia! to grind A: After temporary alignment of the teeth of pinion and girth gear with the mill empty,Fig.8a,re alignment should be undertaken with the mill filled with mill balls,i.e.with reference to the elastic sag in cold con dition,Fig.8b.SINGLE STAGE SAG AG MILLING DESIGN ABSTRACT Single stage semi autogenous autogenous (S AG) milling has become a common design for a variety of ore.This puts the application in the realm of a single mill,single pinion operation.xPower demand up to 16 MW.The SAG mill model in the JKSimMet software has not been shown to accurately.
