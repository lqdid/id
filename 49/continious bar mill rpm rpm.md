## Speeds and Feeds 101
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Spindle Speed Cap.As shown above,the cutter speed (RPM) is defined by the SFM (based on material) and the cutter diameter.With miniature tooling and or certain materials the speed calculation sometimes yields an unrealistic spindle speed.For example,a.047” cutter in 6061 aluminum (SFM 1,000) would return a speed of ~81,000 RPM.Continuous casting,also called strand casting,is the process whereby molten metal is solidified into a &quot;semifinished&quot; billet,bloom,or slab for subsequent rolling in the finishing mills.Prior to the introduction of continuous casting in the 1950s,steel was poured into stationary molds to form ingots.Since then,&quot;continuous casting&quot; has evolved to achieve improved yield,quality.Speed and Feed CalculatorCalculate Speed and Feed for Turning Applications.These calculations are based upon theoretical values and are only intended for planning purposes.A plentyful supply of cutting oil will permit the cutter to run at higher speeds than without cutting oil.Selecting Proper Cutting SpeedsThe approximate values given in table 1 in Appendix A may be use as guide for selecting the proper cutting speed.If the operator finds that the machine,the milling cutter or the workpiece cannot be handled suitably at these speeds,immediate …
