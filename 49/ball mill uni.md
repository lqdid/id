## AMIT 135: Lesson 6 Grinding Circuit Mining Mill Operator.
The mill product can either be finished size ready for processing,or an intermediate size ready for final grinding in a rod mill,ball mill or pebble mill.AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.Ball Mill.Ball Mill consists of cylindrical shell rotating on a horizontal axis mounted on a sturdy Mild Steel Frame.The Ball Mill Shell is designed to withstand the rotational load of the mill charged with the grinding medium and the material to be processed.Emax: High Energy Ball Mill from RETSCH : Quote,RFQ.The E max is a new kind of ball mill specifically designed for high energy milling.The unique combination of high impact and friction produces ultrafine particles in a very short amount of time.The optimized jar design and an unrivaled speed of 2000 min produces the high energy input.Thanks to the new cooling system with water,the high energy input is efficiently employed for …Ball Mills Steel Ball Mills &amp; Lined Ball Mills.Particle size reduction of materials in a ball mill with the presence of metallic balls or other media dates back to the late 1800’s.The basic construction of a ball mill is a cylindrical container with journals at its axis.
