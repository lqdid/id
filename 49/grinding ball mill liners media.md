## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.There are basically two groups of Grinding Mill Liners.Ones with a HIGH PROFILE and those with a LOW PROFILE.The high profile liner is designed to give the media the higher lift.This type will be used in mills that are designed for primary grinding and as a result require the impact of the higher cascade.Ball mills working as the secondary portion of a grinding circuit …Mill (grinding)SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.Operation and Elements of a Closed Circuit Ball Mill System.Cement ball mills typically have two grinding chambers.The first chamber is filled with larger diameter grinding media and lined with lifting liners.The first chamber coarse grinds the feed material and prepares it for the second chamber.The second chamber is the fine grinding chamber.
