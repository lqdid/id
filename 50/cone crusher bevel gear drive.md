## Bevel gear
Bevel gears are gears where the axes of the two shafts intersect and the tooth bearing faces of the gears themselves are conically shaped.Bevel gears are most often mounted on shafts that are 90 degrees apart,but can be designed to work at other angles as well.The pitch surface of bevel gears is a cone.Working principle of SMH Series Hydraulic Cone Crushers: When SMH series hydraulic cone crusher works,the motor drives the outer copper rotate through V belt,host pulley,drive shaft,a small bevel gear,a large bevel gear.Cone Crusher PartsThe alloy steel gear,keyed to the eccentric,is a bevel spur gear in Hydrocone crusher sizes 22 to in.and spiral bevel in crusher sizes above in.The alloy steel pinion is mounted on a turned shaft.The cast steel pinionshaft housing is bolted …In the cone crusher working process will encounter a variety of problems,So,we provides 14 common fault causes and solutions!.The drive shaft produces a strong knock.Causes: Unqualified installation of bevel gears,poor meshing,excessive clearance,too large axial clearance of transmission shaft or gear damage.Solution: Correct meshing.
