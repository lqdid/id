Single cylinder and multi cylinder cone crusher is mainly used in the secondary or tertiary crushing process for the medium and fine crushing.With coarse crushing equipment,it can meet the requirements of 1000t h crushing of all kinds of ores.Is the working principle of these two crushers the same? Do they have any other differences?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The reason impact crushing has not been developed in this way before is because most manufacturers produce both cone crushers and impact crushers,and each product is focused on its own market segment.Moreover,cone crushers are more expensive to purchase than impact crushers and provide greater returns for manufacturers.Gyratory Crusher &amp; Cone Crusher Mantle DifferencesEach use a cone shaped crushing surface,and the same principal in the eccentric is employed to develop the crushing action required.The difference between the two is first the speed that the mantle travels while crushing the ore.A primary revolves at 200 R.P.M.While the Secondary and the Tertiary crusher’s travels between 600 R.P.M.Symons cone crusher (spring cone crusher) can crush materials of above medium hardness.And it is widely used in metallurgy,building,hydropower,transportation,chemical industry,etc.When used with jaw crusher,it can be used as secondary,tertiary or quaternary crushing.
