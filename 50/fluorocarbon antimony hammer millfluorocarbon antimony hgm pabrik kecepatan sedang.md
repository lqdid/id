HYDROFLUORIC ACID AND FLUOROCARBONS by HAROLD W.SCHEELINE November 1973 A private report by the PROCESS ECONOMICS PROGRAM I STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE I MENLO PARK,CALIFORNIA . CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION.Fluorocarbon Plants in the United States,1972 .All Chemical Resistance data for Ethylene Propylene (EPDM) and Fluorocarbon (FKM) contained within this manual has been provided,with written consent,by Parker Hannifin Corporation.Resistance data was taken from Parker’s 2008 edition of the Parker O ring Handbook.Preparation and Characterization of a Novel Fluorocarbon.In this article,preparation approach of a novel fluorocarbon nano material was described.The molecule structure,thermal properties and morphology characterization of the fluorocarbon nano material were studied out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),thermal gravity and differential thermal analysis (TG DTA),transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X ray diffraction.Fluorocarbon assisted atomic layer etching of SiO 2 using cyclic Ar C 4F 8 plasma Dominik Metzler Department of Material Science and Engineering,Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied.
