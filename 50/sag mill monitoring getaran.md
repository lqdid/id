## Protect your SAG Mill by monitoring impacts to the liners
A monitoring system to protect your SAG Mill from critical impacts.If your business operates a SAG Mill,you already know how much of a financial drain replacing mill liner systems can be.And with today’s mills larger than they were in the past,the relining process takes longer and can substantially crimp production through costly shutdowns.Pyke,J D,Katov,K and Ciutina,S T,2018.Modular SAG mill discharge trommel for maintenance flexibility and performance,in Proceedings 14th AusIMM Mill Operators' Conference 2018,pp 613 620 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne).Grinding Emerson USGrinding.Maintain mill availability and reduce operational costs with effective,reliable asset monitoring solutions.Optimized Asset Monitoring For More Efficient Mill Operation Today’s mining operations must keep crucial milling assets online and running optimally,but variations in ore variations particle size,feed rate and moisture.A new monitoring system (MONSAG) intended for indirect measurement of the load filling of a SAG mill is presented.The operating principle is based on the processing of electrical variables of the motor vector control and process variables,complementing the typical bearing pressure measurement and contributing to the process control quality.

## THE EYES HAVE IT: IMPROVING MILL AVAILABILITY THROUGH.
THE EYES HAVE IT: IMPROVING MILL AVAILABILITY THROUGH VISUAL TECHNOLOGY ABSTRACT This paper describes the introduction of two unique tools that discard the longstanding notion that it is impossible to assess liner condition without stopping the mill and pulling the feed chute.Specifically,thisSAG AG SCU SAG AG Sentinel Camera Unit (SCU) Concept of System.The SCU uses the latest technology in high definition imagery within a custom designed housing,permanently affixed to the feed chute to provide a live audio and temperature feed in a running SAG mill and video feed from inside a stationary SAG mill.PhotoanalysisPhotoanalysis is being used on SAG mills worldwide to control the size of rock being crushed.Companies are using this technology to determine the size of particles being processed in the SAG Mill.Having oversize material entering the SAG mill makes an operation less efficient,costing companies money in electrical and maintenance costs.To prevent spillage and overload,the control scheme must allow the ball mill circuit to accept almost any amount of feed rate without overload.At high feed rates,this will compromise the grind size,so the SAG mill feed rate limits must be managed to ensure the right grind size versus throughput tradeoff is achieved.
