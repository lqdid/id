## Ball Mills
Ball mills are commonly used for crushing and grinding the materials into an extremely fine form.The ball mill contains a hollow cylindrical shell that rotates about its axis.This cylinder is filled with balls that are made of stainless steel or rubber to the material contained in it.Optimization of mill performance by using online ball and pulp measurements by B.Clermont* and B.de Haas* Synopsis Ball mills are usually the largest consumers of energy within a mineral concentrator.Comminution is responsible for 50% of the total mineral processing cost.In today’s global markets,expanding mining groups are tryingBall Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If the rate of feed increased,coarser product will be obtained and if speed of rotation is increased the fineness for a given capacity is increases.During grinding,the balls themselves wear and are continuously replaced by new ones so that mill contains balls of various ages.Ball mill produces 1 to 50 ton hr of powder and energy requirement.designed a Denver Ball Mill that can be transported to these faraway and relatively inaccessible properties,either by the age old &quot;muleback&quot; transportation system.or by the modern airplane.As a result these properties may now ob tam a well designed ball mill with the heaviest individual piece weighing only 350 pounds.
